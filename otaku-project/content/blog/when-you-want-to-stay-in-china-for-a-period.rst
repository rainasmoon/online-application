Easy life guidelines for Foreigners
===================================

|

|  

This article will focus on the foreigners to land in China for a couple of days and they need some basic service of China. It's guideline now, and tell me what you want and really care about.

I asked one of my foreign friends, and he said maybe the 1st thing they care about was a apartment. and he gives me a lot of good advises. The app in China here is not all that good at internationalization. they come to China with different Visas, and maybe it is not that easy in China to apply for a Chinese phone number, the usual way is to ask a Chinese friend to help.

the question is can you apply for a Chinese phone number & Chinese bank account via your passport & Visa?

I want to start a small business to try to help foreigners to deal with this kind of thing. I will survey how they are served on the Market now. and try to find out if there are any agency doing this kind of things. I will post some blog where the foreigners surfing the net and I will think and ask what is the most important things they will consider when coming to China first time. pls let me know how can i be more helpful.

\* the different kind of visa in China.
---------------------------------------

there are so many different kind of visa. for student, for travelers, for workers, for journalists.

\* find an apartment.
---------------------

that is not that difficult. maybe the foreigner just want to find a suitable one. I use ZiRoom app to find a reasonable apartment and also you have to get a Chinese phone number first... maybe other institutions can help foreigners do it easily.

\* apply for a phone number.
----------------------------

Nowadays the easiest way is to find a Chinese friend to help to apply one. from now it seems impossible to apply phone number without Chinese ID card. there isn't any agency that can help.

\* apply for a Chinese bank account.
------------------------------------

It seems that one can apply for an account if they have a legal visa in China Bank. do you know the details? pls tell me. and then it will help more people.

\* register an Alipay account.
------------------------------
