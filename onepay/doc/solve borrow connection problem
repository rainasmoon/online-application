SELECT 1

    H2
    MySQL
    Microsoft SQL Server (according to NimChimpsky)
    PostgreSQL
    SQLite

SELECT 1 FROM DUAL

    Oracle

SELECT 1 FROM any_existing_table WHERE 1=0

or

SELECT 1 FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SYSTEM_USERS

    HSQLDB (tested with version 1.8.0.10)

    Note: I tried using a WHERE 1=0 clause on the second query, but it didn't work as a value for Apache Commons DBCP's validationQuery, since the query doesn't return any rows

VALUES 1 or SELECT 1 FROM SYSIBM.SYSDUMMY1

    Apache Derby (via daiscog)

SELECT 1 FROM SYSIBM.SYSDUMMY1

    DB2

select count(*) from systables

    Informix
